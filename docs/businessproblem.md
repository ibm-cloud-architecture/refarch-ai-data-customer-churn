# Story of an unhappy customer Eddy

Eddie is an existing Green Telco Inc customer living in Orlando Fl.  He has been using the services provided by the Green Telco for the last 2 years. 
Eddie is traveling to Europe and last week signed up for a Data plan which he is told will double the original data speed. 

Eddie also bought a phone by paying cash with the understanding that he will get another phone free as part of a promotional plan.

Eddie comes back from Europe trip after 5 days. He logs on the Portal to check if the second phone is shipped or not. The portal shows his claim for the same was denied. 

Eddie is already unhappy that the data plan that he was prescribed was not working in Europe and Asia and on top of this his claim for 2nd phone was denied.

Eddie logs on to the Portal and a chatbot starts a conversation. 

The Goal is to how to use Data and AI to stop churn of Eddie and make him happy customer again.

Update 09/17/19 Target audiences IT Architects who want to understand the components involved and the architecture constraints and design considerations Developers who want to get starting code, and educate themselves on the related technologies Data Scientists who want to complement machine learning with cognitive output like classification Key points Data scientists need different source of data, structured from traditional SQL based database (e.g. the customers and accounts data) and unstructured output of new cognitive services. Data Scientists work hand by hand with application developers to quickly deliver solution to the business. Data access layer to traditional relational data should be done with a micro service approach exposing RESTful API or using modern z OS Connect application. Cloud native apps, microservices, can be deployed in public or private cloud, like IBM Cloud private or IKS based on Kubernetes and containers. Public services like the Watson services can be easily integrated within the solution: Watson Data Platform, Tone Analyzer, Watson Assistant. API management is used to present a unique API for customer data, standardize for consumers like the webapp, even if the back end is Java based or z Connected based. Product recommendations may be added to the solution to support business decision from a chatbot conversation taking into account the churn scoring risk. See this note to explain how to leverage IBM Operational Decision Management for that.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#customer-churn-a-data-ai-reference-implementation-solution","text":"The goals of this implementation is to illustrate how to build an intelligent application using: Data ingestion Cognitive service like Ton Analyzer and Chatbot Integrate with Customer Data base and unstructured data to build a customer churn predictive scoring model Deploy and monitor the model Modern applications are leveraging a set of capabilities to do a better assessment of customer characteristics and deliver the best actions or recommendations.

He has been using the services provided by the Green Telco for the last 2 years. Currently, he is not under any contract. Eddie signed for a new phone which was \"buy one get one\" free bundle. He bought one of the phone with cash and he put the other phone on a monthly plan. For Eddie to get the second phone free he has to submit the receipt to the Green Telco to get an equivalent value of the phone as a credit card. Eddie was traveling to conferences in Madrid and in Bangkok so he also signed up for international text and data service. So he owns two phones: Sam Milky Way Phone 1 $750 paid in full with cash Sam Milky Way Phone 2 $750 on a monthly plan of $30 Upon submission of receipt the Green Telco company sends a Credit Card of $750. Eddie can use the Credit card to pay the balance of $750 for phone 2. Further, Eddie signed for free international text and data for a fee of $10 a month when he is traveling overseas to Madrid and, Bangkok. After Eddie submitted the receipt to the Green Telco provider, Eddie went to Madrid and then to Bangkok. While in Bangkok the data plan and the text plan was very slow and did not perform to the level that the sales person at the Green Telco had suggested Eddie that it will work. By paying $10 per month extra Eddie was told that he will get double the speed. In reality the original speed was very less and even after double the speed, the speed was very less. So, Eddie was not very happy with the service. Eddie, felt that the sales person did not reveal all the information. To add insult to injury when Eddie came back to check on his status for the free phone (he had not received any notification from the Green Telco). So, Eddie contacts the Telecom provider support via a chat bot on the web application. The telecom provider informs Eddie that his claim was rejected and that he does not qualify for the $750 phone. Eddie, who was already not happy with the International Data and Text service he had signed-up for and now he was not getting his refund. The chat bot then checks the customer churn scoring service and finds out that the customer churn predicts a churn with a very high level of confidence and immediately notifies Eddie that a supervisor will contact Eddie to resolve the issue. The supervisor contacts Eddie immediately. He apologizes to Eddie that the speed to begin with is very low and even by adding $10 the double speed does not make much of a difference. This service is mostly designed for texting and browsing emails and some important work and not designed for the kind of quality of service that Eddie is used to in the US. Further the supervisor explains to Eddie that the reason he was not given the $750 is because both the phones have to be on contract payment. Since one of the phone was a cash payment the promotion does not apply. The supervisor acknowledged that to fix the problem, she had called the store and if Eddie goes to the store the previous transaction will be reversed and both the phone would be put on contract and his $750 payment will be expedited. Eddie walks in the store and his problem was resolved. Once, he got the refund in one week he paid the first phone with his cash and the second phone with the $750 visa card. The customer churn service helped Eddie to remain as a customer for the Green Telco.","title":"Business problem"},{"location":"businessproblem/#an-unhappy-customer","text":"Eddie is an existing Green Telco Inc customer living in Orlando Fl.
